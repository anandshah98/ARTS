# Autonomically-Reinforced-Traffic-System-ARTS-
Undergrad final year (2020) capstone project dedicated to solving traffic problems in India by transforming the current static and schedule-based traffic system into a dynamic one. I developed the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm that takes number of vehicles as inputs and outputs a relevant green light signal timing maintaining the current signal sequence.  This project was aimed at not only reducing the traffic burden across all domains but also to decrease pollution caused during travel. This would inevitably lead to sustainable journeys with less time spent waiting at signal junctions and road travel.
